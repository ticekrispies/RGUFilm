        <h2>What is a Short Film?</h2> 
        <hr />
        <p>A short film is any motion picture not long enough in running time to be considered a feature film. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as "an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits". In the United States, short films were generally termed short subjects from the 1920s into the 1970s when confined to two 35mm reels or less, and featurettes for a film of three or four reels. "Short" was an abbreviation for either term.

The increasingly rare industry term "short subject" carries more of an assumption that the film is shown as part of a presentation along with a feature film. Short films are often screened at local, national, or international film festivals and made by independent filmmakers with either a low budget or no budget at all. They are usually funded by film grants, nonprofit organizations, sponsor, or personal funds. Short films are generally used for industry experience and as a platform to showcase talent to secure funding for future projects from private investors, a production company, or film studios.</p>

        <h2>Black America Again (2016)</h2>
        <hr />
        <p><img src="https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-04-at-3.50.52-PM-1478289259-640x237.png" alt="short film " height="250" width="600"  align="right">Black America Again, a poetic short starring Common, features gorgeous black-and-white cinematic portraiture.
At the New York Film Festival opening party this year, Common gave a surprise performance in honor of Ava DuVernay's 13th. Now, DuVernay has produced a short film, directed by Selma cinematographer Bradford Young, to commemorate Common's new album, Black America Again, which dropped last Friday.


 
Shot in effervescent black-and-white, the 21-minute short boasts luminous moving portraits of African Americans against dark backgrounds, interspersed with documentary-style scenes from the streets, where women sing at a memorial for Freddie Gray and children get inspired to learn. At length, the film cuts to Common rapping in an empty street: "We slaves to the blocks/On 'em we spray shots/Leaving our own to lay in a box." </p>

        <h2>A Brief History of Short Films</h2> 
        <hr />
        <p>
		What is a short film and brief History? • A short film is similar to any other film, it has a beginning, middle and end, however its all fitted into usually under 40 minutes. • They are usually low budget films by independent directors. • There are many short films which are made to make people laugh, however people use it a lot to get a serious message across as well. • Short films are usually shown in film festivals and the internet these days, as they are not as popular as they were before.
2. Short films are not that popular anymore in todays media, however they are shown and given awards in festivals, such as the Raindance film festival. Some people create short films in order for charity, such as Red Nose Day and Comic Relief, they create a series of short films in order to get people to donate.
3. The history of short films Short films began in the 1910’s in the United States of America. The films were animated films or live action. Most of the films were made to make people laugh (comedy). In the 1930’s the popularity of short films started to decrease, however in 1955 short films were on the rise again. The rise was because of Charlie Chaplin, he starting to make short comedy films again, but since then short films haven’t really been that popular. Pixar and Disney have made a couple of short films in the recent times, such as; For the Birds, Geri’s Game and The Lamp.
4. 7 rules for writing short films by Raindance 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. The shorter the better Keep the practicalities of writing in mind Make it visual Find single moments Tell a story Engage the reader Beware of the clichés
